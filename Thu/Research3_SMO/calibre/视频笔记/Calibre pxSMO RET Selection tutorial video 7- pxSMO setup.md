  >But on all of their jobs, use all process window conditions. There are some special cases that can come up. Uh, in the past when we've really wanted to try and optimize common up the focus we have. Put in specific extreme, defocus conditions. And in that case the decorate job I've run with the nominal and the two defocus only conditions but again that's a special case you'll get good mileage out of um Using all the different process when the conditions and decorate improve and polish.
  
- Scanner: 三个选项, 对于实验可以使用custom, 实际应用之中需要具体选的
- image model
> both are actually all three of pixsmo pixopC and verification. Um, it's true. It lets you choose whether to use the aerial image or the CM1 and then one image, Just a note about this, um, Because during SMO, You're really in a process definition, or process exploration mode. Almost always a CM1 model doesn't exist. Um same one models are highly customized to the illumination, right? If you think of how the C1 model operates it takes a particular range of It takes a particular range of aerial image and it performs a transformational in that aerial image.To approximate what happens in the resist, right? Um, So it goes without saying that if you're changing the source, You could potentially have a much different looking aerial image coming into the tool, then the CM1 model was calibrated with. And so there's a potential for the CMR model to do things that are are a little unexpected. So it's always most applicable. I think when we're doing the um SML run to use this aerial image mode, okay?

-  Source Symmetry  : 定义最终光源的对称形式,xy, x,y, 对角, 任意
- pupil Fill: 
>2.9 percent pupil Starting. Five percent is the recommended minimum pupil, if this gets too low, Um, remember that, these are being these sources are being defined with mirrors. So, You're actually not losing any intensity. Um, as you're shaping, the different Sources. So what can happen is if the pupil becomes too small All that input energy can get focused into too small of a region. You can actually burn the lens on the scanner. So that's why we enforce this, this minimum pupil percent

- debug level: And the debug level just changes. The verbosity of the output from pixmo. There's various debug levels here that have messages that are typically usually only useful for internal developers.

 > X and Y, which of the pixel and sigma space. So, the default for asml is . 06. And I typically use multiples of the . 06. So, for instance, 0.24, this is a pretty huge pixel. But if you're looking to really quickly progress through SML, Um, and test something. This is a nice option to set.

 > let me Configure this like we were discussing earlier, just turn off. Process window conditions, for the start job. Don't forget this Advanced tab a little bit, so. These options here, Sigma Min and sigma Max. These Define. Both the minimum and maximum Sigma limits. Where pixels are allowed to turn on? Sigma Min and sigma Max are set. Automatically. In the ASML and Nikon exposure modes, so users don't have to worry about that. But if for instance, you wanted to do something. Special and further limit the sigma men and sigma Max, where pixels could occupy, you can turn these options on and enter a value here. The um, way that SML operates, it creates a stocks model for each pixel. And cash is it on disk for fast operation? And so, typically, the default is that after the run completes, we delete and clean up this socks directory. If you wanted to keep it, you could uncheck this. We also have the option here if you were doing a bunch of runs. To use a common socks directory in the layout in the layout directory, and this would allow this would let you skip creating that socks, directory. Each time. Uh, that that are run. This started but typically we leave this off. Uh, parallel PW is enabled by default this allows Um, I guess we can talk about the parallel options here. So the default mode of operation. Is that parallel pw is turned on. And what this means is that Each process window condition. For each clip is sent to a different CPU . So later on the presentation, you'll see, um, you'll use this information to To determine. The number of CPUs that you request on the grid for maximum parallelization. But it's important because Um, You, you can parallelize these jobs past a certain point. So in this case we have five jobs or pardon me five process window conditions. And we have seve enabled gauges. So requesting a number of CPUs. Higher than 36. Won't make sense   , any any extra CPUs will just sit idle. So it's important to know that so that you're using the grid um courteously and not wasting CPUs for for other grid users. And then, finally, the next feature I'll show you is Um, which is useful for you guys. Um, Everything that we can figure in the GUI. Really just links up. The different text options. That configure the tool. This is the same information you would manually type in if you're setting this tool up. So Um,

> for the nominal. So if you're experimenting with this maybe you don't care as much about nominal convergence. You can click this. You can leave this as one or you can even set a higher weight here for nominal. Like I said before, this just means that in job, five polish, When the nominal process, window conditions objective is being calculated, it'll get it multiple multiplied by factor of five, so it will make it count more. Than any of the other conditions and get more attention and hopefully get optimized to a higher degree.
