### 疑问
1. instantiated as
2. centered on the hotspot_layer shapes
3. the matching layer order passed to the CMACRO call
### EXAMPLE
1.

2. In the following figure, MAX_LENGTH divides a hotspot into seven equal segments. <u>This example uses MAX_SEARCH, so segment 2 and segment 7 do not cover the entire section of the drawn layer due to nearby geometries. </u> 
   The resulting four patterns created using MAX_LENGTH are shown in the following figure. The patterns show that the marker for the pattern is the portion of the hotspot shape captured per segment. The pattern corresponding to segments 3, 4, 5, and 6 show that the hotspot does not extend out to the extent, <u>because the length of the segments is less than max_length</u>.

### 3.Pattern Matching Reference Library (PMRL)

### 下一周的主要任务
1. 完成SVRF的 pattern capture 的编写
2. 调研大预言模型
### Idea
1. kalyout 的界面真的好看呀看一看这个软件
2. mentor 是用 SVRF 写的
